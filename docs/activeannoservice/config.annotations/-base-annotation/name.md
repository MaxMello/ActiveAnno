# name

`val name: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)

The primary, human readable name of the annotation. Should be clear, but not too long. Additional explanations might be given
via Layout elements, but in the best case, that would not be necessary. For example "Sentiment score" for sentiment, or
"Contains personal data" for a boolean annotation.
