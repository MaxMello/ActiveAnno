## Package document.annotation

### Types

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [Annotation](-annotation.md) | Base class for any annotation. An [Annotation](-annotation.md) is defined as the actual value associated with an AnnotationDefinition. For example, a BooleanAnnotationDefinition will produce a single annotation of boolean type. This annotation might be created by a human annotator, or automatically generated or imported. Every [Annotation](-annotation.md) needs to be associated with an annotation ID / key in a map or comparable structure`sealed class Annotation<T : `[`Target`](../annotationdefinition.target/-target/index.md)`>` |
| [AnnotationMap](-annotation-map.md) | `typealias AnnotationMap = `[`MutableMap`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-mutable-map/index.html)`<`[`AnnotationID`](../annotationdefinition/-annotation-i-d.md)`, `[`Annotation`](-annotation.md)`<*>>` |
| [AnnotationResult](-annotation-result/index.md) | Data class representing a single annotation result by either an annotator, a curator or a merge of annotator responses by the policy logic.`data class AnnotationResult` |
| [AnnotationResultCreator](-annotation-result-creator/index.md) | The [AnnotationResultCreator](-annotation-result-creator/index.md) represents by whom an [AnnotationResult](-annotation-result/index.md) was created, which can be by humans ([Annotator](-annotation-result-creator/-annotator/index.md), [Curator](-annotation-result-creator/-curator/index.md)), a machine [Generators](-annotation-result-creator/-generators/index.md), externally [Import](-annotation-result-creator/-import/index.md) or through consensus of all the previous [Consensus](-annotation-result-creator/-consensus/index.md).`sealed class AnnotationResultCreator` |
| [AnnotationResultID](-annotation-result-i-d.md) | `typealias AnnotationResultID = `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html) |
| [DocumentTargetAnnotation](-document-target-annotation/index.md) | An annotation which is targeted on the whole document, not a specific part of it. For example, a class label "SPAM" or "NO SPAM" for the whole document.`data class DocumentTargetAnnotation : `[`Annotation`](-annotation.md)`<`[`DocumentTarget`](../annotationdefinition.target/-document-target/index.md)`>` |
| [ExportStatistics](-export-statistics/index.md) | Data class holding information about where and how often the annotations were exported.`data class ExportStatistics` |
| [FinalizedAnnotationResult](-finalized-annotation-result/index.md) | Data class representing a finalized annotation, which can be one or multiple annotations (referenced by their IDs). It also contains meta data about why the document was finalized, which policy was used, when the finalization happened, and statistics about how the annotations were exported.`data class FinalizedAnnotationResult` |
| [FinalizedReason](-finalized-reason/index.md) | Sealed class with two options why a annotation can be finalized`sealed class FinalizedReason` |
| [GeneratedAnnotationData](-generated-annotation-data/index.md) | When a Project has any AnnotationGenerator defined through the AnnotationSchema, they will store their results here. Every time annotation generation is triggered, every generator will be executed again and a new instance of this class will be added to the ProjectAnnotationData`data class GeneratedAnnotationData` |
| [InteractionLog](-interaction-log/index.md) | Data class representing log data from the interaction of the user with the document during annotation.`data class InteractionLog` |
| [RestCall](-rest-call/index.md) | Information about an export via rest call, mainly the route called, how often, and when.`data class RestCall` |
| [Span](-span/index.md) | A span is a single piece of a string, expressed by [begin](-span/begin.md) and [end](-span/end.md).`data class Span` |
| [SpanTargetAnnotation](-span-target-annotation/index.md) | All annotation values for a single AnnotationDefinition on a span target are represented by a [SpanTargetAnnotation](-span-target-annotation/index.md). For example, a document might have spans of positive and negative sentiment. All annotations regarding sentiment would be stored in a single [SpanTargetAnnotation](-span-target-annotation/index.md), holding a list of [annotations](-span-target-annotation/annotations.md) of which each defines the spans concering the annotation as well as the actual value, in this case POSITIVE or NEGATIVE sentiment.`data class SpanTargetAnnotation : `[`Annotation`](-annotation.md)`<`[`SpanTarget`](../annotationdefinition.target/-span-target/index.md)`>` |
| [SpanTargetSingleAnnotation](-span-target-single-annotation/index.md) | A [SpanTargetSingleAnnotation](-span-target-single-annotation/index.md) maps a single annotation value to the [spans](-span-target-single-annotation/spans.md) (often only a single span) which the annotation value is associated with.`data class SpanTargetSingleAnnotation` |
| [ValueToProbability](-value-to-probability/index.md) | In some contexts, a [value](-value-to-probability/value.md) might have an associated [probability](-value-to-probability/probability.md). This is the case when annotations are imported or generated with a probability of how likely this annotation has the value.`data class ValueToProbability` |
| [WebHookExport](-web-hook-export/index.md) | Information about a web hook export, containing the export URL, how often it was tries, if it was successful, and possible failure logs for debugging purposes (for example when the web hook returns a 401 unauthorized etc.)`data class WebHookExport` |

### Functions

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [buildAnnotationResult](build-annotation-result.md) | Build an [AnnotationResult](-annotation-result/index.md) from an [GeneratedAnnotationData](-generated-annotation-data/index.md), transforming the annotations based on the AnnotationDefinitions transformGeneratedAnnotation method`fun `[`GeneratedAnnotationData`](-generated-annotation-data/index.md)`.buildAnnotationResult(document: `[`Document`](../document/-document/index.md)`, projectID: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`, annotationSchema: `[`DenormalizedAnnotationSchema`](../project.annotationschema/-denormalized-annotation-schema/index.md)`): `[`AnnotationResult`](-annotation-result/index.md) |
