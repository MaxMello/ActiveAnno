# onlyGeneratorIncorrect

`val onlyGeneratorIncorrect: `[`Boolean`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-boolean/index.html)

Only analyze documents where the generator is wrong.
For duration statistics as well as all document-level statistics, this will apply to check if the generator was wrong anywhere on the whole
document / all annotations. For the annotation-specific statistics, this will apply to check if the generator was wrong for that specific
annotation.
